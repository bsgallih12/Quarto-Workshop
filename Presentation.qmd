## What You Need

-   R
-   RStudio
-   GitHub
-   [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com) Account

## What Will Be Covered

-   Adding Pages
-   Navigation Panel Changes
-   Adding socials
-   Adding CV/Resume
-   Adding Projects
-   Changing Themes
-   Publishing Website Online (For Free with [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com))

## Adding Pages

- As with most websites, you might wish to add pages
  - Maybe a blog? CV? Resume? Portfolio?
  - A majority of this happens in the `quarto.yml` file
    - We will spend a lot of time toying with this file today

## Navigation Panel Changes

- There are a couple options (sidebar, navbar or combo of both)
  - I would use a navbar if you don't have too many headings
  - Sidebar if you have a lot
  - Most websites use a navbar and its the one we'll use
  - For more info on sidebar options, see the Quarto [documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-navigation.html)

## Adding Socials

- Pretty flexible
- Uses bootstrap icons
  - A full list can be found [here](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)

## Adding CV/Resume

- You can do this a couple ways
  - Pure HTML version (difficult if not well versed in HTML)
  - Just a download option (Word)
  - Both readable and with a download option (PDF)
- We'll use the last one for this workshop and its super simple

## Adding Projects/Talks/Presentations

- There are a couple options here:
  - Just upload a repository of PDF versions of slides
  - Create a reveal.js slide that can be hosted within the website
  - Could link out to a video (e.g., Google Drive) or YT talk (anything with a URL)
- I'll show you all 3 options

## Changing Theme Appearance

- The default theme isn't the only one you can do
- By default there are 25 pre-made options
  - `flatly` is the default. `darkly` is the dark-mode version
  - Can find all of them [here](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/tree/main/src/resources/formats/revealjs/themes)
- However, they're open source and the files can be changed or modified
  - As long as you know CSS/SCSS
    - I don't know either one (well), BUT ChatGPT and Google help
    - I'll show you a couple things quick

## Publishing Your Website

::::{.panel-tabset}

### Publishing

- Several options to publish
- Personally I think Netlify is the best because you get some choice over your web address (and it's free^1^)
- But a full list of options are [here](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/)
  
:::{.callout-important}
# Caution
^1^Netlify will charge you should your site start receiving a lot of traffic. In which case other options might be better depending on how much traffic you expect to generate.
