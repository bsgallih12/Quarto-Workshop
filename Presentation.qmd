## Adding Pages

- As with most websites, you might wish to add pages

  - A majority of this happens in the `quarto.yml` file
    - We will spend a lot of time toying with this file today

## Navigation Panel Changes

## Adding Socials

- Pretty flexible
- Uses bootstrap icons
  - A full list can be found [here](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)

## Adding CV/Resume

## Adding Projects/Talks/Presentations

## Changing Theme Appearance

- The default theme isn't the only one you can do
- By default there are 12 pre-made options
  - `flatly` is the default. `darkly` is the dark-mode version
  - Can find all of them [here](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/tree/main/src/resources/formats/revealjs/themes)
- However, they're open source and the files can be changed or modified
  - As long as you know SCSS
    - I don't know either one (well), BUT ChatGPT and Google help
    - I'll show you a couple things quick

## Publishing Your Website

::::{.panel-tabset}

### Publishing

- Several options to publish
- Personally I think Netlify is the best because you get some choice over your web address (and it's free^1^)
  
:::{.callout-important}
# Caution
^1^Netlify will charge you should your site start receiving a lot of traffic. In which case other options might be better depending on how much traffic you expect to generate.
